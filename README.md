### Parameter Syntax

- `--get`: Specify the GET parameters as key-value pairs separated by spaces. Example: `--get "key1=value1" "key2=value2"`
- `--post`: Specify the POST parameters as key-value pairs separated by spaces. Example: `--post "key1=value1" "key2=value2"`
- `--cookie`: Specify the cookies as key-value pairs separated by spaces. Example: `--cookie "key1=value1" "key2=value2"`
- `--proxy`: Specify the proxy address for sending requests. Example: `--proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080"`
- `--payload-file`: Specify the file containing the SQL injection payloads. By default, `payloads.txt` is used.
